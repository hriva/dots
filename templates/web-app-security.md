# Web App Security

## 1. Authentication

A robust authentication mechanism is your first line of defence against unauthorised access. Relying on a well-supported, trusted authentication library (for instance, Clerk) can streamline the process of user login, registration, and session handling.

- **Use a trusted auth library:** Libraries or platforms with active development, community support, and frequent security patches reduce the risks associated with custom, ad-hoc code.
- **Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA):** MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide additional evidence of identity (e.g., a one-time code on their phone).
- **Handle password reset & session management:** Ensure secure password reset workflows (such as time-limited links or tokens) and strict session expiration policies to minimise the likelihood of unauthorised usage.
- **Authenticate every API request:** Each request should include verifiable tokens or credentials to confirm the user's identity and authority. This prevents malicious actors from bypassing the authentication layer.

## 2. Middleware Protection

Middleware can act as a gatekeeper within your application, providing a central point for enforcing security policies and permissions.

- **Add middleware to protect sensitive routes:** Use middleware layers to verify authentication status and user role before granting access to confidential features or data.
- **Validate user identity and permissions:** Always confirm that the requesting entity is indeed allowed to perform the requested operation. This minimises the risk of privilege escalation attacks.

---

## 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC ensures that users can only access functions and data relevant to their role (e.g., admin, user, guest). This principle limits the damage that can be done if an account is compromised or misused.

- **Define user roles:** Assign roles based on business requirements—examples may include admins with full access, general users with limited privileges, and guests with minimal capabilities.
- **Restrict access based on roles:** Use checks within your code or database queries to allow or deny access depending on the user's assigned role. This helps enforce the principle of least privilege.

## 4. Sensitive Data Handling

Safeguarding credentials, API keys, and other secrets is paramount to preventing malicious actors from exploiting them.

- **Store secrets in `.env` files:** Keep sensitive information out of your public codebase by storing it in local environment variables rather than in source code.
- **NEVER expose secrets to client-side code:** Client-side code is easily viewed in the browser, so secrets must stay on the server side only.
- **Add `.env` to `.gitignore`:** Prevent accidental commits of sensitive data to version control by ignoring environment files and other confidential resources.

---

## 5. Error Handling

Proper error handling helps maintain a good user experience without inadvertently revealing details that attackers could use.

- **Show user-friendly and generic error messages:** Provide basic information such as "Something went wrong" or "Invalid credentials," rather than revealing database or system details.
- **Log detailed error messages only on the server:** Capture stack traces, query logs, and other diagnostic data in secure server logs, where they can assist debugging but remain hidden from users.

---

## 6. Input Validation

User input is a common attack vector, making thorough validation and sanitisation essential.

- **Sanitise and validate all user input:** Protect against malicious input by filtering out disallowed characters, applying length limits, and verifying data types.
- **Prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks:** Use parameterised queries, escaping mechanisms, and content-security policies to minimise the risk of injecting harmful code.

---

## 7. Database Security

How data is stored, accessed, and queried is a cornerstone of any secure system.

- **Use a trusted ORM or platform:** ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) such as Prisma, Sequelize, or a secure platform like Supabase can abstract away many low-level security pitfalls.
- **Enable Row-Level Security (RLS) where possible:** RLS allows fine-grained control over which rows can be accessed by which user, adding another layer of data protection.
- **Avoid writing raw queries directly:** Parameterised queries and abstractions help prevent injection vulnerabilities and reduce the scope for human error.

---

## 8. Hosting

Where you deploy your application can significantly impact security. Managed platforms often come with built-in safeguards.

- **Host on secure, managed platforms:** Services like Vercel, AWS, or GCP frequently update their underlying infrastructure to address new threats.
- **Ensure firewall, DDoS protection, and automatic updates:** A well-configured firewall, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) defences, and regularly patched servers guard against the most common and disruptive attacks.

---

## 9. Secure Communications

Ensuring data transmission security is crucial to protect sensitive information.

- **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure your application strictly uses HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- **Regularly update SSL/TLS certificates:** Automate certificate renewal processes (e.g., via Let's Encrypt).
- **Use secure HTTP headers:** Implement headers such as `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `Content-Security-Policy`.

---

## 10. Logging and Monitoring

Monitoring provides visibility into potential attacks and unusual activities.

- **Implement real-time monitoring and alerts:** Detect and respond swiftly to suspicious activities.
- **Regularly audit logs:** Periodically review logs for anomalies and security incidents.
- **Protect logs from tampering:** Store logs securely to prevent attackers from altering evidence.

---

## 11. Security Testing and Audits

Regular testing helps identify vulnerabilities proactively.

- **Conduct regular vulnerability scans:** Use automated scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) regularly.
- **Perform penetration testing:** Schedule periodic manual penetration tests.
- **Static and dynamic code analysis:** Include automated tools to scan code repositories and deployed apps for vulnerabilities.

---

## 12. Backup and Disaster Recovery

Reliable backups protect your data from accidental loss or malicious compromise.

- **Regular automated backups:** Set up scheduled backups, stored securely and remotely.
- **Test backup restoration regularly:** Ensure backups are usable in emergencies.
- **Implement disaster recovery plans:** Clearly define how you'll restore services in case of a severe security incident.

---

## 13. Dependency Management

Third-party libraries often introduce security risks.

- **Regularly update dependencies:** Keep third-party libraries up-to-date to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Use automated dependency scanners:** Tools like Dependabot or Snyk can identify outdated or vulnerable packages.
- **Review dependency licences and security history:** Avoid libraries with poor security records or unsupported maintenance.

---

## 14. Rate Limiting and Anti-Abuse

Protect your application from brute-force and automated attacks.

- **Implement rate limiting on APIs and authentication routes:** Protects against brute-force and credential-stuffing attacks.
- **Use CAPTCHA or similar verification techniques:** Prevent automated bots from abusing resources.
- **Monitor for anomalous usage patterns:** Identify suspicious or automated behaviours promptly.

---

## 15. Data Privacy Compliance

Respecting user privacy isn't just ethical—it's also legally required.

- **Comply with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, Australian Privacy Principles):** Clearly disclose data collection and use practices.
- **Implement user consent management:** Allow users control over their data.
- **Data anonymisation and encryption:** Protect sensitive user data both at rest and during processing.

---

## 16. Incident Response & Security Awareness

Preparing your team for security incidents and ensuring continual awareness can drastically reduce the impact of security breaches.

- **Create an Incident Response Plan:** Clearly define roles and actions for security breaches.
- **Regularly train team members:** Conduct periodic security training to maintain awareness.
- **Perform tabletop exercises:** Regularly simulate incidents to test readiness.

---

## 17. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security

If you're deploying cloud infrastructure through code (Terraform, CloudFormation), this area is critical.

- **Scan infrastructure code for misconfigurations:** Use automated scanning tools (e.g., Checkov, Bridgecrew).
- **Enforce the principle of least privilege for cloud resources:** Ensure cloud resources have minimal required permissions.
